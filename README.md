Raynet Tracker project.


This project has been set up as a repository for some work I am doing on a tracking system for Raynet. 
whilst APRS works well for sweep, an idea has been bounced around for fixed way points to be able to communicate via data mode back to a central station. The goal is to allow RFID tags to be tracked at various checkpoints and data transmitted back to a central hub via RF (VHF/UHF).
